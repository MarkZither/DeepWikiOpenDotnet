# DeepWiki .NET Constitution

## Purpose & Scope
This Constitution governs the design, development, testing, and operation of the DeepWiki .NET implementation: a C#/.NET server using the Microsoft Agent Framework, Entity Framework with vector storage (SQL Server prioritized, Postgres supported), a Blazor frontend, and a local‑first ML strategy (Ollama first, OpenAI-compatible APIs next, cloud providers pluggable).
This document defines non-negotiable principles, governance rules, and operational policies that all contributors MUST follow.

## Core Principles

### I. Test‑First (NON‑NEGOTIABLE)
- Tests MUST be written before implementation for every new feature or bugfix. Unit tests (xUnit), component tests (bUnit), and E2E tests (Playwright) are required where applicable. PRs MUST include passing tests and meet CI thresholds before merging.
- Rationale: Ensures correctness and reduces regressions; streaming parser and prompt changes MUST include snapshot-based tests.

### II. Reproducibility & Determinism
- All LLM interactions that influence content or parsing MUST be recorded as deterministic snapshots. Playbacks of snapshots MUST reproduce parser behavior and be used in tests and debugging.
- Rationale: Streaming and nondeterministic outputs require reproducible inputs to reliably validate parsers and generation logic.

### III. Local‑First ML
- The project MUST prioritize local runtimes (Ollama and compatible) for development and testing. OpenAI-compatible APIs are a supported secondary option. Cloud provider adapters (Azure/AWS/GCP) MUST be pluggable and conform to a Provider abstraction to avoid vendor lock-in.
- Rationale: Local-first enables fast iteration, offline development, and lower cost for CI and dev workflows.

### IV. Observability & Cost Visibility
- Services MUST emit structured logs, metrics, and traces. LLM usage (calls, token counts, latency, errors) MUST be tracked and surfaced in dashboards to make cost and performance visible. Alerting MUST exist for abnormal usage or cost spikes.
- Rationale: LLM calls can incur significant cost and reliability risk; observability is required for incident response and cost control.

### V. Security & Privacy
- Secrets MUST be stored in secure stores and rotated regularly. Snapshots, logs, and caches that contain user data MUST be redacted of PII before long-term storage. Sensitive artifacts at rest MUST be encrypted.
- Rationale: Protect user privacy and comply with regulatory requirements.

### VI. Simplicity & Incremental Design
- Prefer simple, well-documented APIs and incremental changes. Breaking changes MUST be justified, documented, and follow the Governance procedure.
- Rationale: Easier maintenance and safer evolution of system contracts.

### VII. Entity Framework Core & Database-Agnostic Architecture (MANDATORY)
- **Rule**: ALL database operations MUST use Entity Framework Core 10.x. No manual ADO.NET or raw SQL in repositories.
- **Database Abstraction**: Model layer (DocumentEntity, shared interfaces) lives in `DeepWiki.Data` project ONLY. Model uses `ReadOnlyMemory<float>` for embeddings (database-agnostic, zero-alloc). Database-specific types (SqlVector, pgvector.Vector) conversion happens ONLY in provider layers.
- **Migrations**: Migrations are ALWAYS generated by `dotnet ef migrations add` command. NEVER manually create .cs migration files or write SQL. Each provider project MUST include `IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<T>`.
- **Multiple Database Support**: Shared layer (model + interfaces) with provider-specific implementations (SqlServer, Postgres, etc.). Pattern: each provider implements same interfaces with database-specific queries. No code duplication; 100% test parity across providers.
- **Vector Type Mapping**: 
  - **SQL Server**: Column type `vector(1536)`, Model type `ReadOnlyMemory<float>`, Provider type `float[]`, Value converter handles mapping, HNSW index with m=16, ef_construction=200
  - **PostgreSQL**: Column type `vector(1536)` (pgvector extension), Model type `ReadOnlyMemory<float>` (same), Provider type `pgvector.Vector` or `float[]`, Value converter strategy identical to SQL Server
- **Concurrency**: Optimistic concurrency with `UpdatedAt` as `IsConcurrencyToken()`. Catch `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` in application layer. SQL Server provider MUST include 3-retry exponential backoff for transient failures.
- **Performance Requirements**: Vector query <500ms @ 10K documents, <2s @ 3M documents; Bulk upsert 1000 docs <10s; Memory <500MB for bulk operations; ≥90% code coverage on data access layer.
- Rationale: EF abstraction enables database portability, value converters maintain model simplicity, migrations as code ensure reproducibility and version control.

### VIII. Microsoft Agent Framework Compatibility (MANDATORY)
- **Rule**: Knowledge access services (IVectorStore, ITokenizationService, IEmbeddingService) MUST be designed as Microsoft Agent Framework-compatible abstractions.
- **Requirements**: Services are callable from Agent Framework tool bindings without wrapper logic. Result types (VectorQueryResult, EmbeddingResponse, etc.) MUST be JSON-serializable for agent context passing. Error handling MUST return clear, agent-recoverable errors (not exceptions that break agent reasoning loops).
- **Tool Integration**: Agent Framework tools (e.g., `queryKnowledge` tool) call service methods via dependency injection. Binding patterns and examples MUST be documented and tested.
- **Gate**: All RAG-related features MUST pass Agent Framework Compatibility Review before merge. Review checklist: (1) Is service callable from tool bindings? (2) Are result types JSON-serializable? (3) Does error handling gracefully degrade? (4) Are integration examples provided?
- Rationale: Agent Framework is the primary consumer of knowledge services; compatibility ensures agents can reason over retrieved knowledge without abstraction overhead.

## Storage & Data Policies
- **Primary vector storage**: SQL Server vector type (preferred). Postgres (pgvector) MUST be supported as an alternative.
- **Vector indexing & retrieval**: Vector fields MUST be indexed; query performance expectations and index maintenance MUST be documented in EF migrations and PR descriptions. HNSW indexing strategy documented in code configuration.
- **EF Migrations**: ALL migrations MUST be tool-generated via `dotnet ef migrations add`. Each migration touching vector fields MUST include: (1) migration checklist (index impact, data transformation, downtime expectations), (2) rollback steps, (3) performance benchmarks for large datasets.
- **Backups & retention**: Use platform-recommended backups for vector stores. Snapshot retention policies (short/medium/long-term) apply to LLM artifacts per LLM Policy section below.
- **Code organization**: Abstractions layer (`DeepWiki.Data`), provider-specific layers (`DeepWiki.Data.SqlServer`, `DeepWiki.Data.Postgres`), and provider-agnostic tests ensure clean separation and portability.
- **Breaking changes**: Major schema or EF migration changes MUST include impact analysis, migration plan, rollback steps, and performance validation before merge.

---

## LLM Policy & Snapshotting
- Provider precedence: Local-first (Ollama) MUST be default; OpenAI-compatible APIs are next; cloud providers are pluggable. Implementations MUST satisfy a Provider interface and be configurable.
- Prompt versioning: Prompt templates and prompt changes MUST be versioned in the repo with changelogs and rationale. Changes that affect generation or parsing MUST include snapshot comparisons.
- Snapshot recording: All LLM requests that impact wiki content or parsing MUST create a snapshot containing request metadata, streaming chunks with timestamps, response hash, and redaction info. Snapshots MUST be stored in `./llm-snapshots/` and referenced in tests.
- PII & retention: Snapshots MUST be scanned for PII and redacted before medium/long-term storage. Short-term raw captures MAY be allowed in secured environments but MUST be deleted per retention policy.

### Snapshot JSON Schema (reference)
Include this as a canonical example in the repo and use for fixtures.
```json
{
  "id": "snapshot-YYYYMMDD-0001",
  "created_at": "2026-01-12T15:04:05Z",
  "model": { "provider": "ollama", "id": "vicuna-13b", "version": "v2026-01" },
  "request": { "prompt": "...", "temperature": 0.0, "streaming": true, "metadata": { "feature": "wiki-page-generation", "commit": "abc123" } },
  "stream": [ { "time": "2026-01-12T15:04:06.100Z", "chunk": "This is", "role": "assistant" } ],
  "response_hash": "sha256:...",
  "redacted": { "fields": ["user_email", "phone"] },
  "retention_policy": { "tier": "short-term", "keep_days": 30 }
}
```

Retention tiers: short-term (30 days raw), medium-term (365 days redacted), long-term (archival, redacted and reviewed). Teams MUST document environmental tiers.

---

## Caching & Snapshot Playbacks
- Cache policy: Local wiki cache MUST be versioned and include references to snapshot IDs used to generate the entry. Invalidation triggers: content edit, prompt version change, manual invalidate, or explicit cache expiry.
- Snapshot playback: Tests and debugging tools MUST support playback of snapshots to reproduce parsing and rendering without live LLM calls. Snapshot-based tests MUST be part of CI for parsing logic.

---

## Frontend, Accessibility & i18n
- Blazor components MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA conformance for major user flows. bUnit tests MUST cover key components and accessibility assertions.
- i18n: All UI strings MUST be localizable. Translation workflow and default English strings MUST be documented.

---

## Testing & CI Requirements
- Test suites: Unit (xUnit), component (bUnit), integration/contract (TestServer/in-memory), and E2E (Playwright).
- Gating: PRs MUST pass unit, component, and integration tests in CI. E2E tests SHOULD run on merge; critical features MUST include E2E coverage before release.
- Snapshot tests: Streaming parsers and prompt-dependent logic MUST include snapshot playbacks in tests.

---

## Observability & Cost Monitoring
- Logs: Use structured JSON logs with standard fields (timestamp, level, correlation_id, feature, snapshot_id).
- Metrics: Track LLM call counts, token usage, latency, error rates, and cache hit rates. Provide dashboards for cost and usage trends.
- Alerts & Runbooks: Set thresholds for abnormal LLM costs or error spikes and document runbook actions for alerts.

---

## Security & Compliance
- Secrets: Use platform secret stores; do NOT commit secrets to the repo. Enforce periodic rotation and least-privilege access.
- Encryption: Sensitive snapshots and caches MUST be encrypted at rest.
- Access controls: Limit raw snapshot access to authorized roles; audit access to sensitive artifacts.

---

## Database Code Organization
- **Project structure**: 
  - `DeepWiki.Data/` - Shared entities and interfaces (model-agnostic, `ReadOnlyMemory<float>` for embeddings)
  - `DeepWiki.Data.SqlServer/` - SQL Server-specific DbContext, configuration, repositories, migrations, health checks
  - `DeepWiki.Data.Postgres/` - Postgres-specific implementations (mirror structure)
  - `DeepWiki.Data.Abstractions/` - RAG service abstractions (IVectorStore, ITokenizationService, IEmbeddingService)
  - `DeepWiki.Rag.Core/` - RAG implementations using EF Core entities
  - Tests colocated with projects; shared integration test suites with Testcontainers for real database validation

---

## EF Migrations Workflow & Best Practices
- **Adding a column**: (1) Modify entity property, (2) Run `dotnet ef migrations add DescriptiveName -p src/DeepWiki.Data.SqlServer`, (3) Review generated file (NO manual SQL edits), (4) Test on fresh database, (5) Commit migration file.
- **Creating indexes on vector columns**: (1) Modify `EntityConfiguration` with `.HasIndex()` and index method annotation, (2) Run `dotnet ef migrations add CreateVectorIndex`, (3) EF generates correct SQL with HNSW/BTREE/HASH as specified.
- **What NOT to do**: ❌ Create migrations manually, ❌ Write SQL by hand, ❌ Edit ModelSnapshot.cs, ❌ Use raw SQL in repositories, ❌ Create different migrations for different providers manually.
- **Version control**: All migrations are committed. History is maintained and rollbacks supported via migration downgrade commands.

---

## Database Design Decisions (LOCKED)
- **ReadOnlyMemory<float> for embeddings**: Zero-alloc, performance-optimized, stack-allocated. Provider layers handle conversion to database-specific types.
- **EF Core value converters**: Enable database-agnostic model with provider-specific storage mappings.
- **HNSW indexes**: SQL Server 2025 and PostgreSQL both supported; optimized for vector similarity search.
- **Testcontainers integration**: Real database containers for integration testing (not mocks) ensure accurate behavior validation.
- **IVectorStore/ITokenizationService/IEmbeddingService abstractions**: Async, support pagination, repository filtering, similarity search; Agent Framework-compatible.
